# CLI-Student-Record-Management-System

The mini-project “CLI Student Record System Project” is a command-line interface application using the python programming language. This project compiled in VS-Code In this CLI application, you can do basic tasks like adding the student info, view the added student, search the students, ..etc.

Also to increase the readability, I have broken the application in different functions/modules. Each function of the project extensively use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling and module in python.

Note: Don’t copy and paste the code for your project. Use the code to learn and do the project yourself.
